            This site is a project for my ReactJs class. It is inspired by
            PasteBin website, and it's intended to exercise our skills in React
            Hooks, Axios, TailwindCss styling, Routes and TSX elements design.
            On this new version i've implemented a local server to store json's
            with my data using express.js .
